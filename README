NAME
    RT-Extension-BooleanCustomField - CF with checkbox to set or unset its
    value

DESCRIPTION
    Provide a new type of custom field, which value can only be set or
    unset. Editing a BooleanCustomField is done through a single checkbox.

    This enhances the behaviour allowed by core Request Tracker through
    SelectCustomField, where editing a SelectCustomField, with only a single
    value, should be done through a dropdown menu, radio buttons or
    checkboxes, including the single value and no value. With
    BooleanCustomField, you have only a single checkbox to check or uncheck.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.0 or greater
